# ocaml-4dmaze-render
Objective Caml code to render a 4 dimensional perfect maze (there are gates between 3d mazes : blue indicate it is possible to teleport in both directions, and red and yellow collors indicate that only one direction is possible). 

This is my first project ever on a real computer language if I remember well (dates back from 2012).

## Things to fix
- Comments in english.
- Alogrithms
- Simplification (especially less function arguments)
- Better use of types/structures
