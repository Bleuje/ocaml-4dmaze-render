# ocaml-4dmaze-render
Objective Caml code to render a 4 dimensional perfect maze (with gates between 3d mazes).
This is my first project ever on a real computer language if I remember well (dates back from 2012).

Possible overview of a rendered maze :

## Things to fix
- Comments in english.
- Alogrithms
- Simplification (especially less function arguments)
- Better use of types/structures
